REST web-application
====================

Use Symfony 2.7 (or 2.8) and any open-source 3-rd party libraries or bundles to create a web application that provides API access to web server access logs.

Implement as many of the features in the following list as you can within a timeframe you consider to be reasonable and provide access to a GitHub or BitBucket repository with your code.

1. Create simple REST web-application (API)
-------------------------------------------
* It should allow to retrieve 10/25/50/100 of the most recent records across all log files.
* There should be a way to filter results by date and time.
* An API client should be able to provide a text string for a simple search (show only the records that contain an exact match).

2. Add pagination
-----------------
Provide a way to retrieve previous/next 10/25/50/100 lines.

3. Add regex search
--------------------
Allow the API user to provide a regular expression, that will be used to filter the results.

4. Add support for multiple occurrences of the same filter
----------------------------------------------------------

If the API request contains multiple values for any filters, consider it logical OR for date/time filter, and logical AND for content filter (text or regex). For example, the API client should be allowed with a single query to request records created between 8:00 to 9:00 today *AND* between 5:00 to 6:00 yesterday, that also either match the regular expression '[a..z]+234[a..z]+' *OR* contain the word 'localhost'.

5. Add user authentication against local *nix user database
-----------------------------------------------------------
Client authentication could be of any type (HTTP Basic, session-based or OAuth), but user should be allowed to login only if the same login and password would allow him to login as a local *nix machine user as well.

Preconditions and oher requirements
-----------------------------------
* Log files (multiple) are located in some directory on the web-server.
* Log format - Common Log Format (CLF), see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats
* Caching log file contents in some sort of a database is the recommended approach. Database type selection (RDBMS or NoSQL) is up to you. Check the log files for new content and save it to the database when appropriate.
* Provide automated tests - *both unit tests and functional tests*.
* Please note that we will be reviewing the code so follow PSR2 (https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md), choose meaningful names, and provide comments where necessary.
* Provide a database diagram or another document describing the database schema along with the explanation of why you selected this database type and structure, and what other options were considered.
