Console Command Chaining
========================

Create a Symfony bundle that implements command chaining functionality. Other Symfony bundles in the application
may register their console commands to be members of a command chain. When a user runs the main command in a chain,
all other commands registered in this chain should be executed as well. Commands registered as chain members
can no longer be executed on their own.

Provide two other sample bundles to demonstrate the work of this application.

Detailed Requirements
---------------------

Using Symfony 2.7+ create a bundle called ChainCommandBundle.

Any other bundle installed in the same Symfony application should be able to create their console commands
(standard Symfony functionality) and register them as members of a command chain.

For example, some bundle introduces a console command, called `some:command`. Another bundle introduces
another command `another:command` and registers it as a member of command chain of `some:command`. Now, when a user
runs `php app/console some:command`, both `some:command` and `another:command` should be executed. Commands registered
as chain members can no longer be executed on their own, so `php app/console another:command` should produce an error.

For the demonstration purposes create two bundles FooBundle and BarBundle.

FooBundle should introduce the `foo:hello` console command. This command, if there were no other commands registered
in its chain, would produce the following output:
```bash
$ php app/console foo:hello
Hello from Foo!
```

BarBundle should introduce the `bar:hi` console command and register it as a member of `foo:hello`.
If this command were not registered as a member of a chain, it would produce the following output:
```bash
$ php app/console bar:hi
Hi from Bar!
```

Because `bar:hi` is registered as a member of `foo:hello` command chain, the actual output should now become:

```bash
$ php app/console foo:hello
Hello from Foo!
Hi from Bar!
```

```bash
$ php app/console bar:hi
Error: bar:hi command is a member of foo:hello command chain and cannot be executed on its own.
```

Logging
-------

Implement detailed logging for chained commands, so that after execution of `php app/console foo:hello`
the application log file will contain the following records (with actual time obviously):
```
[2016-01-29 09:08:31] foo:hello is a master command of a command chain that has registered member commands
[2016-01-29 09:08:31] bar:hi registered as a member of foo:hello command chain
[2016-01-29 09:08:31] Executing foo:hello command itself first:
[2016-01-29 09:08:32] Hello from Foo!
[2016-01-29 09:08:32] Executing foo:hello chain members:
[2016-01-29 09:08:32] Hi from Bar!
[2016-01-29 09:08:32] Execution of foo:hello chain completed.
```

Tests
-----

Create *unit tests* for all code in the ChainCommandBundle.
Create a *functional test* to check that command chaining functionality works.


> NB: FooBundle and BarBundle are just for the demo. You do not need to create any tests for them.

> NB: Do not forget to write *negative tests* as well.
> A positive test checks if a function behaves as expected with its expected input.
> A *negative test* checks if a function behaves as expected when something goes wrong. An expected result in this case
> could be a thrown exception, or returned boolean `false` - as defined by the developer of the tested method.

Other Requirements
------------------
- PSR-2
- SOLID
- http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html
- All classes and methods should be documented with phpdoc, containing not only the list of parameters and their types,
but also a short description of what the intended purpose of this method or class is.


After the task is completed, provide a link to the repository on GitHub or BitBucket.
